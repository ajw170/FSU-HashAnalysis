COP4531 - Project 1 - Hash Analysis




Phase 1: Implementing the first part of Analysis and the Max Bucket Size methods:

I began the project by implementing the Analysis method.  For the most part, the calculations were straightforward
with the exception of the "actual search time" parameter.

To determine the actual search time, I realized I had to consider that the search time for any given search is given as
follows:

O(1) + O(size of bucket).

However, to get the "actual" search time, it is necessary to iterate through all the non empty buckets and determine the search
time for each bucket, given by 1 + (size), summing these values up, and dividing by the number of non-empty buckets.  Actually, the
search time would be 1 + (average of non-empty bucket sizes).  The "1" is the initial hash and bucket identification.

During development, I had an issue with understanding the type definitions.  When I wanted to compute the max bucket size, I first
was declaring a List Iterator, which is not what I wanted; in fact is was an FSU Vector iterator that I needed.  Since Vector was
hardcoded into the aa.h file as a type, we didn't have type definition support for the hash table vector type.



Phase 2:  Implementing the Actual vs. Theoretical bucket sizes
